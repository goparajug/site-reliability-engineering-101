# Site Reliability Engineering Tutorial (SRE-101)

I will join as a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) intern at a Fortune 500 listed company in this summer of 2023. Now, I plan to take the `#100dayschallenge` for learning and sharing my journey through SRE resources.

I have planned the [contents for next 100 days](https://medium.com/@shantoroy/learning-about-site-reliability-engineering-with-the-100daysofsre-challenge-66380323c0d1), and I will be posting one blog post each and everyday under the hashtag `#100daysofSRE`. ✌️
